## setup and launch the project
### Installing and using the virtual environment for python is optional but recommended, to install, type: 
1. ```python -m venv ./path/for/venv/installation``` OR ```python -m venv c:\path\for\venv\installation``` in Powershell (using the venv folder as installation path is easier though)

### Activate venv (from the project directory / parent directory of venv folder):
2. Type ```venv\Scripts\Activate``` in Powershell for activation, and type ```deactivate``` directly to deactivate it
3. Type ```source .venv/Scripts/activate``` in bash for activation, and type ```deactivate``` directly to deactivate it

### Installing the required packages:
4. Type ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
